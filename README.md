Project DS V1 
-------------

Project DS V1 is the first working version of my end-of-degree DevSecOps pipeline project. Built over four days, it demonstrates a CI/CD workflow that integrates security scanning and GitOps-style deployment, laying the foundation for a production-ready DevSecOps platform.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Architecture Overview
	â€¢	CI/CD: GitHub Actions
	â€¢	Containerization: Docker
	â€¢	Registry: Harbor (self-hosted on AWS EC2, deployed via Helm)
	â€¢	Cluster: k3s running on AWS EC2
	â€¢	Security: Trivy image scanning
	â€¢	GitOps: Argo CD + secondary repo (argo-anchor)
	â€¢	Config updates: Automated with yq

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Pipeline Workflow
	1.	Checkout Code â†’ GitHub Actions pulls the repository.
	2.	Build & Test â†’ Docker image build + unit tests.
	3.	Scan with Trivy â†’ Detects CVEs and vulnerabilities.
	4.	Push to Harbor â†’ Secure image storage in private registry.
	5.	Update Deployment Repo â†’ yq updates the image tag in argo-anchor.
	6.	Argo CD Sync â†’ Argo CD deploys the updated image to the k3s cluster.

Average pipeline runtime: ~2 minutes.

ðŸ”¹ Setup & Usage

Prerequisites
	â€¢	AWS EC2 instances (t3.medium for Harbor, any small instance for k3s)
	â€¢	Helm installed on your local machine
	â€¢	Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
	â€¢	GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled
	â€¢	Trivy scanner installed or used via GitHub Action

Deployment Steps

1.	Deploy Harbor with Helm on a t3.medium EC2:

```
  helm repo add harbor https://helm.goharbor.io
  helm install harbor harbor/harbor -f values.yaml
```

2.	Set up a k3s cluster on EC2:

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

3.	Configure GitHub Actions secrets:

- HARBOR_USERNAME
- HARBOR_PASSWORD
- HARBOR_URL
- GITHUB_TOKEN (for pushing updates to argo-anchor)

4.	Push code changes â†’ pipeline runs automatically.

ðŸ”¹ Roadmap

Project DS will evolve into a full DevSecOps pipeline in the coming months. Planned features include:
	â€¢	Kubescape â†’ Kubernetes posture and compliance scanning
	â€¢	Kyverno â†’ Cluster-wide policy enforcement
	â€¢	Cilium â†’ Advanced networking and observability
	â€¢	Vault â†’ Secrets management and dynamic credentials

ðŸ”¹ Status

âœ… Proof of concept (V1) complete
ðŸš§ Next steps: expand to production-grade DevSecOps pipeline
